Create and share customisable interactive Maps. Embed OpenStreetMap, add Overlays like location aware Photos and Tracks with elevation profiles.

## Description ##

* <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/demo/">See the Demo &raquo;</a>
* <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/try/">Try the Editor &raquo;</a>
* <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/">Read the Docs &raquo;</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/morehawes/waymark">View on GitHub &raquo;</a>

Features:

* Easy to use, customisable and developer friendly.
* Use the <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/editor/">Editor</a> to create Maps containing Overlays (Markers, Lines and Shapes).
* Every Overlay can be given a title, image and description; which is displayed once the Overlay is clicked.
* Set styles and options once using <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/">Types</a>, then simply select the appropriate Type when adding an Overlay. Lines can display arrows to indicate direction.
* Add Maps to your content using the Waymark <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/">Shortcode</a>, or link to the <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/map/route-map/">Map Details</a> page. 
* <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap">OpenStreetMap</a> is the default <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/basemaps/">Basemap</a>, with support for multiple Basemaps.
* Images uploaded with location data (EXIF) will have a Marker placed where the photo was taken.
* Group Maps together using <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/collections/">Collections</a> and display multiple Maps at once.
* Import from GPX, KML and GeoJSON formats (GeoJSON properties can also be imported). You can export Maps and Collections in the same formats and let your visitors do it too.
* An interactive profile chart can be displayed for Tracks uploaded with elevation data.
* Add extra information to your Maps using <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/meta/">Meta</a>; these are customisable form inputs that allow you to add additional data to your Maps. 
* <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/submissions/">Submissions</a> allow registered users, or guests to create Maps from the front-end of your site. You can control who can Submit Maps, what editor features are available and whether submissions should be approved before they are published.
* For the developers: Maps are stored using the custom post type `waymark_map`, Meta is stored as Custom Fields and Collections use the `waymark_collection` Taxonomy. Most elements can be styled using CSS and have sensibly named `waymark-` classes.

Waymark is free, with no features to "unlock". I try to keep the plugin well supported, so please feel free to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/waymark/#new-topic-0">reach out</a> with any questions or feedback.

## Installation ##

With Waymark enabled, click on the "Maps" link in the sidebar to create and edit Maps. Once you are happy with your Map, copy the Waymark shortcode and add it to your content.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Is There a Demo? ###

Yes, <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/demo/">here</a>.

### Can I Get More Help? ###

Yes, please view the <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/">Documentation</a>.

### Does Waymark Support Google Maps? ###

While Google Basemaps can be added to Waymark, Waymark does not use the Google Maps API (it uses <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>). There are other plugins available that are made specifically for Google Maps.

### Can I Translate the Plugin? ###

Please! Waymark is localization ready, <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/waymark/">translation contributions</a> are greatly appreciated.

### Acknowledgements? ###

### 0.9.28.4 ###

* Fixed a Map duplication bug. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/duplicating-a-map-ends-in-anempty-page/">reporting this</a>.

### 0.9.28.3 ###

* More fixes!

### 0.9.28.2 ###

* Fixed a bug where Maps initally hidden on page load are broken. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/map-does-not-center-and-not-zoom-to-content-when-first-hidden/">reporting this</a>.

* Fix for a weird glitch where *sometimes* the Map will not "wake" if the mouse is hovering over that Map during initial page load. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hovering-over-map-to-zoom/">reporting this</a>.

### 0.9.28.1 ###

* Fixed a bug where Line direction arrows were being shown for hidden Lines. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hiding-track-with-direction-arrows-sometimes-does-not-work/#post-16817555">reporting this</a>.

### 0.9.28 ###

* **Direction Arrows**
  * Lines can now have a direction associated with them. To add a direction, click on a Line while editing a Map and select from the direction dropdown. Thanks <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-direction-of-travel/">for</a> <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/direction-arrows-in-route/">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/morehawes/waymark/issues/4">suggestions</a>!
* **Interaction**
	* By default, Waymark disables scroll zoom until the user hovers over the Map for 2 seconds. This behaviour can now be customised in Waymark Settings > Maps > Interaction. Settings allow you to adjust the delay and optionally display a message to the user while scroll zoom is disabled, for example "Click or Hover to Wake".
	* Fixed an annoying glitch where mouse "wheeling" over the elevation chart caused the Map to zoom.
	* Added Max Zoom setting in Maps > Basemaps, which was <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-zoom-level-limit/">requested a long time ago</a>!
* **Permalinks**
	* Customise your Map and Collection URLs in Waymark Settings > Advanced > Permalinks by specifying Map and Collection slugs (i.e. example.com/[map-slug]/example-map/ and example.com/[collection-slug]/example-collection/). Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/wkndwlk/">wkndwlk</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/map-and-collection-slugs/">suggestion</a>.
* **GeoJSON Properties**
	* You can now read GeoJSON feature properties when importing from file by adding them in Waymark Settings > Overlays > Properties. If Waymark finds data for these properties it will be added to the Overlay description when it is imported. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/waimek/">waimek</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/using-data-from-geojson/">suggestion</a>.
* **Collection Export**
	* You can now Export entire Collections when embedding them with the Shortcode. Click Details in the Shortcode Header to see the Export feature. The Public Export (Settings > Map > Misc.) and Shortcode Header (Settings > Map > Shortcodes) Settings must be enabled. As with Maps only the currently visible Overlays are exported, with GeoJSON, KML and GPX supported. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/wimzwag/">wimzwag</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/download-all-geojson-gpx/">suggestion</a>.
* Fixed a bug where elevation data remained visible even when a Line was hidden. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/canuck069/">Nigel</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gpx-tracks-shadowed-with-evelation-colour/">pointing this out</a>.

### 0.9.27 ###

* Added Map Scale Setting, which displays a distance scale on the Map in kilometers and miles (Settings > Map > Misc.)

### 0.9.26 ###

* Individual Overlay Types can now be Shown/Hidden initially using the Shortcode, overriding the "Show Initially" Setting for each. Use the `hide_marker`, `show_marker`, `hide_line`, `show_line`, `hide_shape`, `show_shape` Shortcode parameters, providing one or multiple (comma separated) <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/#type-keys">Type Keys</a>. For example:

`[Waymark map_id="1234" hide_marker="photo,alert" show_line="green"]`

Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/hansolo68/">hansolo68</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/show-markers-initially-as-shortcode/">suggestion</a>.
