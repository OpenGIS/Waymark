**If you find value in Waymark please consider supporting it's continued development through [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/OpenGIS). Any amount is appreciated.**

### Creating Maps

Use the intuitive [Editor](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/editor/) to create Maps with one, or thousands of interactive Overlays.

- **Overlays** - Create Markers, Lines and Shapes with a:
  - Title
  - Image (Media Library or link to external image)
  - Description (Rich text editor, HTML supported)
  - [Type](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/) (defined in Settings)
- **Import**
  - GPX
  - KML
  - GeoJSON
  - EXIF (Image location metadata)
  - [Elevation data](https://www.waymark.dev/map/track-with-elevation/) (adds an interactive profile chart for Lines with elevation data)
- **[Meta](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/meta/)** - Add extra information to your Maps; these are customisable form inputs that allow you to add additional content to your Maps.
- **[Types](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/)** - Set options to visually distinguish between Overlays (colours/icons etc.), then select it when using the Editor.
- **[Collections](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/collections/)** - Group Maps together and display multiple Maps at once. Create complex Collection hierarchies to suit your needs and associate Maps with multiple Collections.
- **[Submissions](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/submissions/)** - Allow registered users, or guests to create Maps from the front-end of your site. You can control who can Submit Maps, what editor features are available and whether submissions should be approved before they are published.

### Displaying Maps

Embed your Maps using the `[Waymark]` Shortcode, or link to the [Map Details](https://www.waymark.dev/map/route-map/) page.

- **[Shortcodes](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/)**
  - Display a single Map, or a [Collection](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/collections/) of Maps anywhere that Shortcodes are supported.
  - An optional Shortcode Header displays the Map/Collection title, a link to the Map Details page and any [Meta](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/meta/).
  - Display a [Marker](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/#shortcode-markers) defined through the Shortcode.
  - Display [Files](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/#shortcode-files) (GPX, KML & GeoJSON) from a URL without the need for a Map to be created.
  - Display a Basemap only, without any Overlays by providing centre and zoom parameters.
- **[Basemaps](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/basemaps/)** - Uses [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap) by default, with support for multiple raster tiled/"slippy" Basemaps. You can switch Basemaps using the Overlay Filter.
- **Overlay Filter** - Allow the user to filter which Overlays are currently visible on the Map.
- **Export**
  - (Optionally) Let anyone Export Maps into GPX, KML and GeoJSON formats through the Shortcode Header or on the Map Details page.
  - Works on mobile devices.

### Customising

Built to be flexible, Waymark has lots of [Settings](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/settings/) and [Types](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/) provide one place to control how Overlays (Markers/Lines/Shapes) are displayed.

Marker Icons can be provided as:
  - Font Icons ([Ionic Icons v2](https://ionic.io/ionicons/v2/cheatsheet.html)/[Font Awesome v4](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/cheatsheet/))
  - Simple Text, or [Emojis](https://emojifinder.com/) (i.e. 🏕️, 🚩, 📸).
  - Custom HTML (good ol' `<img src="https://example.com/icon.svg">`, or a more complex structure). So you can pretty much create any kind of Icon you want.

For developers:

- Most elements can be [styled using CSS](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/styling-with-css-selectors/) and have sensibly named `waymark-` classes.
- WordPress integration:
  - Maps are stored using the custom post type `waymark_map`.
  - Collections use the `waymark_collection` Taxonomy.
  - Embed Maps using the `[Waymark]` [Shortcode](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/) anywhere they are supported, or dynamically using the `do_shortcode(["Waymark"])` [function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/).
- Geographical data is stored in [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) format. [Types](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/) are specified using the `type` Property, i.e. `{feature: { geometry: { type: 'Point', coordinates: [0, 0] } }, properties: { type: 'Alert', title: 'Bridge Removed!' }`.
- Specify which GeoJSON feature properties to store when importing (Settings > Overlays > Properties). These can be automatically appended to the Overlay Description, or accessed programatically via the `layer.feature.properties` Object.
- Maps are displayed using the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript library, which is bundled with Waymark and can be extended using the callback function.
- Use the [JavaScript callback functions](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/callback-function/) to extend Waymark functionality client-side, provided either globally (for integration with *all* Waymark Maps) or provided as a [Shortcode parameter](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/#callback-function).

Be sure to check out [Map First](https://github.com/opengis/map-first), a minimal WordPress theme with an *obsession* for Maps (it's open-source too and contains lots of comments about customisations).

**Waymark is free, open-source ([GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)) and a labour of Love**. I try to keep the plugin well supported, so please feel free to <a href="https://forms.gle/mthqAgSsMoTPM8SR9">reach out</a> with any issues, questions or feedback.

### Development

> [!NOTE]
> To develop locally you will need to have both Node.js and NPM [installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) is used to run the build script, which compiles the JavaScript and CSS and performs some other tasks.

`
# Clone the repository (and the Waymark JS submodule)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/opengis/waymark.git

# Navigate to the Waymark directory
cd waymark

# Install the dependencies (or pnpm/yarn install)
npm install

# Run the build script
grunt
`

The build script will watch for changes to the JavaScript and CSS files.

Pull requests are welcome!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Waymark JS](https://www.waymark.dev/js) is responsible for the Viewer and Editor and is included as a Git submodule (`/waymark-js` directory). View on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark-JS/).

== Screenshots ==

1. Add Overlays (Markers, Lines and Shapes) to create detailed interactive Maps. You can import/export from GPX/KML/GeoJSON.
2. Every Overlay can be given a title, image and description. Marker images can be displayed as a gallery.
3. Waymark features a clean, intuitive Editor for creating and editing your Maps. Overlays are customisable using Types, which allow you set styles once (colours/icons etc.), so you can simply select it when you are adding to the Map. 
4. If you have more than one Basemap, you can switch between them when viewing the Map. Overlays can be shown/hidden by Type.
5. Use Meta to provide extra information about your Maps. Meta inputs are customisable and can be grouped. 
6. The Map Details page displays an image gallery, elevation profile, export options, featured image and all Meta provided for the Map.
7. Add Maps to your content using the Waymark Shortcode. You can choose which Meta is displayed.
8. Organise Maps with Collections and display multiple Maps at once using the Shortcode. Collections can be nested and Maps can be associated with multiple Collections.
9. Waymark was designed to be very flexible, with lots of Settings to choose from.
10. Documentation and Help is available from the <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/">Waymark</a> website.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.0 = 

- Added the ability to show/hide all Types initially when using the Shortcode by specifying "*" as the Type key. For example, to initially hide all Marker Types, except "photo" and "alert", use `[Waymark map_id="1234" hide_marker="*" show_marker="photo,alert"]`. Thanks to [Association Franc-Comtoise du Chemin de Compostelle](https://www.af-ccc.fr) for requesting this.
- Improved debugging output.

= 1.3.2 = 

Collection background loading bug fix. Thanks to [zerider](https://wordpress.org/support/users/zerider/) for [reporting this](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/collection-map/).

= 1.3.0 = 

- **Overlay Properties** - Read GeoJSON feature properties when importing (Settings > Overlays > Properties). If Waymark finds data for the specified property keys they will stored upon import. These can be automatically appended to the Overlay Description, or accessed programatically via the `layer.feature.properties` Object. Thanks to [dariospace](https://github.com/dariospace) for the [requesting](https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark/issues/45) the return of this feature.

= 1.2.0 = 

Enable or disable various WordPress features of the Map Custom Post Type, including the new ability to enable comments and excerpt integration. This Setting is Available in Settings > Advanced > Post Type. Thanks to [YosoraLife](https://github.com/YosoraLife) for requesting this ([here](https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark/pull/42) and [here](https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark/issues/44)).

= 1.1.8 = 

Show/Hide Overlay Types bug fix. Thanks to [YosoraLife](https://github.com/YosoraLife) for raising this [issue](https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark/issues/41).

Another Collection Map link fix.

= 1.1.6 =

Removed Link to/from Maps Setting in [Collection options](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/settings/#misc-collection_options). Links to/from Collections and Maps will now be displayed by default, but can be hidden using CSS if desired. Thanks to [wkndwlk](https://wordpress.org/support/users/wkndwlk/) for [reporting this](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/links-within-waymarks-on-collection-maps/).

This allows you to extend Waymark functionality similar to the [Shortcode Callback](https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/#callback-function), however it will apply to *all* Waymark Maps.
- Fix for Export/Overlay Filter [bug](https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark/issues/32).
- Other fixes and improvements.

= 1.0.2 =

Fix for colours not appearing correctly in the Overlay Filter. Thanks to [geomfranzo](https://wordpress.org/support/users/geomfranzo/) for [raising this](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sort-line-markers-by-name-bug-line-color/).

= 1.0.0 =

Thanks for helping Waymark get to Version 1! ❤️

* [Map First](https://github.com/opengis/map-first) - A minimal WordPress theme with an *obsession* for Maps. It's open-source too and contains lots of comments about customisations.
* Added Total Ascent and Descent to Elevation Profile. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MaximeChallon">MaximeChallon</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark/pull/29">Pull Request</a> :)
* Improved rendering of multiple Maps through the Collection Shortcode, where the initial view would sometimes not be set correctly to view all Map data.
* Updated documentation.
* Lots of other bug fixes and improvements.

= 0.9.30 =

* **<a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/marker-clustering/">Marker Clustering</a>**
    * Once enabled, Markers will be stacked when they are close together. This can help to reduce clutter on the Map.
    * You can enable this feature in Settings > Maps > Clustering, or using the `show_cluster="1"` Shortcode option. 
    * There are also settings to adjust the cluster radius and what what zoom level to start clustering at.
* Added `file_start_type` and `file_end_type` options to the <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/shortcodes/#shortcode-files">Shortcode Files</a> feature, which allow you to automatically add a Marker of the specified type to the start and/or end of all Lines in the file. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/digbymaass/">digbymaass</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/shortcode-option-for-start-marker/">suggestion</a>.

= 0.9.29.3 =

* Added a Collections > "Shortcode Method" Setting. This allows you to choose whether Map data is loaded in the Background (via AJAX), or Embedded in the page when embedding a Collection via the Shortcode. Embedding may be a bad idea for LARGE COLLECTIONS, but *may* resolve some (JavaScript) issues where Collections are not displaying correctly.

= 0.9.29.2 =

* Fixed a bug where the Shortcode Zoom and Centre parameters were being ignored. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/killianweid">killianweid</a> for creating <a href="https://github.com/opengis/waymark/issues/25">this issue</a>.

* Fixed a bug with some KML files when loading from URL using Shortcode. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/henkna/">henkna</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/kml-fails-to-load/">letting me know about this</a>.
* Added Leaflet Basemap examples URL to Settings > Basemaps.
* Minor bug fixes and improvements.

= 0.9.28.6 =

Added `max_zoom` Shortcode option, which will prevent the Map from being zoomed in further that this zoom level (usually ~1-20 range). Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/shortcode-ma_zoom-request/">suggestion</a>.

= 0.9.28.5 =

Added `elevation_units` (metric/imperial) Shortcode option, which will override the Waymark > Elevation > Elevation Units option. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/randombuffalo">randombuffalo</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/opengis/waymark/issues/22">suggestion</a>.

= 0.9.28.4 =

* Fixed a Map duplication bug. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/duplicating-a-map-ends-in-anempty-page/">reporting this</a>.

= 0.9.28.3 =

* More fixes!

= 0.9.28.2 =

* Fixed a bug where Maps initally hidden on page load are broken. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/map-does-not-center-and-not-zoom-to-content-when-first-hidden/">reporting this</a>.

* Fix for a weird glitch where *sometimes* the Map will not "wake" if the mouse is hovering over that Map during initial page load. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hovering-over-map-to-zoom/">reporting this</a>.

= 0.9.28.1 =

* Fixed a bug where Line direction arrows were being shown for hidden Lines. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/microteq/">microteq</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hiding-track-with-direction-arrows-sometimes-does-not-work/#post-16817555">reporting this</a>.

= 0.9.28 =

* **Direction Arrows**
  * Lines can now have a direction associated with them. To add a direction, click on a Line while editing a Map and select from the direction dropdown. Thanks <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-direction-of-travel/">for</a> <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/direction-arrows-in-route/">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/opengis/waymark/issues/4">suggestions</a>!
* **Interaction**
	* By default, Waymark disables scroll zoom until the user hovers over the Map for 2 seconds. This behaviour can now be customised in Waymark Settings > Maps > Interaction. Settings allow you to adjust the delay and optionally display a message to the user while scroll zoom is disabled, for example "Click or Hover to Wake".
	* Fixed an annoying glitch where mouse "wheeling" over the elevation chart caused the Map to zoom.
	* Added Max Zoom setting in Maps > Basemaps, which was <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-zoom-level-limit/">requested a long time ago</a>!
* **Permalinks**
	* Customise your Map and Collection URLs in Waymark Settings > Advanced > Permalinks by specifying Map and Collection slugs (i.e. example.com/[map-slug]/example-map/ and example.com/[collection-slug]/example-collection/). Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/wkndwlk/">wkndwlk</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/map-and-collection-slugs/">suggestion</a>.
* **GeoJSON Properties**
	* You can now read GeoJSON feature properties when importing from file by adding them in Waymark Settings > Overlays > Properties. If Waymark finds data for these properties it will be added to the Overlay description when it is imported. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/waimek/">waimek</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/using-data-from-geojson/">suggestion</a>.
* **Collection Export**
	* You can now Export entire Collections when embedding them with the Shortcode. Click Details in the Shortcode Header to see the Export feature. The Public Export (Settings > Map > Misc.) and Shortcode Header (Settings > Map > Shortcodes) Settings must be enabled. As with Maps only the currently visible Overlays are exported, with GeoJSON, KML and GPX supported. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/wimzwag/">wimzwag</a> for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/download-all-geojson-gpx/">suggestion</a>.
* Fixed a bug where elevation data remained visible even when a Line was hidden. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/canuck069/">Nigel</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gpx-tracks-shadowed-with-evelation-colour/">pointing this out</a>.

= 0.9.27 =

* Added Map Scale Setting, which displays a distance scale on the Map in kilometers and miles (Settings > Map > Misc.)

= 0.9.26 =

* Individual Overlay Types can now be Shown/Hidden initially using the Shortcode, overriding the "Show Initially" Setting for each. Use the `hide_marker`, `show_marker`, `hide_line`, `show_line`, `hide_shape`, `show_shape` Shortcode parameters, providing one or multiple (comma separated) <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/docs/types/#type-keys">Type Keys</a>. For example:

`[Waymark map_id="1234" hide_marker="photo,alert" show_line="green"]`

	* Files (GPX, KML & GeoJSON) can now be displayed using the Shortcode, without the need for a Map to be created. For example:<br> <code>[Waymark file_url="http://example.com/track.gpx"]</code><br> By default, <em>all</em> Overlays (Markers/Lines/Shapes) will be displayed using the default Type (i.e. the first listed in Settings). You can specify a different Type to use like this:<code>[Waymark file_url="http://example.com/track.gpx" file_line_type="photo"]</code>. Thanks to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/golf1025/" rel="nofollow">Jan de Boer</a> for this <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/migrate-gpx-from-other-app/">suggestion</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/users/yorobo/">yorobo</a> for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/cant-upload-kml-gpl-file/">the reminder</a>.
